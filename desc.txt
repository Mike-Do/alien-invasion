In Alien Invasion, a ship appears at the bottom center of the screen that the player moves (Left and Right) to destroy alien ships. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears and move Across and Down the screen. The player shoots with the spacebar.

As the game progresses, a new fleet appears once the first wave of aliens have been shot that moves faster than the previous fleet. 

If an alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life/ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
